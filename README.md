# Revoke
Revoke is a social accountability app that turns screen-time discipline into a squad-governed system.  
It combines hard app blocking, real-time social pressure, and a live focus score to keep behavior change visible.

## Current Features

- Regime engine for time blocks and daily usage limits
- Reality Check onboarding with estimated vs actual usage comparison
- Squad system: create/join squads, share code, and monitor member focus scores
- Plea and judgment flow: request temporary unlocks, squad voting, enforced outcomes
- Focus Score system with live card visualization and detailed explainer page
- Profile management: nickname editing, logout, and account deletion
- Real-time permission gatekeeping and native sync for monitor reliability
- Firebase-backed auth, squad state, and plea lifecycle

## UX/Design Highlights
- Unified black/orange visual language with branded components
- Consistent app-wide input styling and slider behavior
- Tap-first interactions (copy squad code, focus-score drilldown, squad HUD controls)
- Performance-focused UI updates with caching and optimistic feedback patterns

## Upcoming
- Onboarding final polish (interaction and copy refinement)
- Website blocker flow consolidation (single-source behavior)
- Vandalism feature (wallpaper penalties)
